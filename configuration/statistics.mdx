## Overview

The **Statistics** module lets you convert a channel into a **live counter** that updates automatically to display key server numbers.

Common counters include:

- Total members
- Users only / bots only
- Text / voice channels
- Categories
- Boost count
- Pending members
- Total channels

Typical channel names look like:

- `Members: 12,367`
- `Bots: 67`
- `Text Channels: 128`

---

## How it works

This module is **database-driven** and refreshed using a **scheduled task loop**.

### 1) When you create a counter

When you run:

`statistics set <type> <channel>`

the bot will:

1. Calculate the current value for the chosen counter type.
2. Rename the selected channel into a counter format (example: `Members: 12,367`).
3. Store the counter in the database (`counter` collection) using:
   - `guild_id`
   - `channel_id`
   - `option` (the counter type)
   - `last_update`

Only **one counter per type per server** is stored.  
Example: you can’t set two separate `members` counters in the same server.

---

## Automatic updates

Every ~10 minutes, the bot:

1. Loads counter entries that are due for refresh.
2. Checks the guild and channel still exist.
3. Recomputes the latest value.
4. Updates the channel name if needed.
5. Handles Discord edit rate limits by deferring updates when necessary.
6. Removes invalid entries automatically (deleted channels, missing data, invalid option types).

This keeps your counters reliable over time without manual cleanup.

## Requirements

### Permissions (bot)

To rename channels, the bot needs:

- **Manage Channels**
- **View Channel**

If you use counters on private channels, ensure the bot has access to those channels too.

### Permissions (user)

To configure counters, the user needs:

- **Manage Channels**

### Premium requirement

This module is gated behind `@premium_guild()`.

If the server is not premium, Statistics commands will be blocked.

## Commands

### Base command

The base command is:

- `statistics` (aliases: `counter`, `stats`)

If used without a subcommand, it shows help.

---

### Create a counter

<CodeGroup>

```bash Syntax
statistics set <type> <channel>
```

```bash Example
statistics set members #members
```

</CodeGroup>

---

### Remove a counter from a channel

<CodeGroup>

```bash Syntax
statistics remove <channel>
```

```bash Example
statistics remove #members
```

</CodeGroup>

---

### List all counters

<CodeGroup>

```bash Syntax
statistics list
```

```bash Example
statistics list
```

</CodeGroup>

This displays all counters configured in the server.

---

### Clear all counters

<CodeGroup>

```bash Syntax
statistics clear
```

```bash Example
statistics clear
```

</CodeGroup>

This prompts for confirmation, then removes **all** counters for the server.

---

## Supported counter types

- `members`
- `users_only`
- `bots_only`
- `pending_members`
- `boosts`
- `all_channels`
- `text_channels`
- `voice_channels`
- `categories`
- `announcement_channels`

---

## Notes & limitations

- Counters update on a schedule (not instant live updates).
- Channel rename operations are rate-limited by Discord; the module automatically delays updates if it hits limits.
- If a counter channel is deleted, the module removes the saved counter entry automatically.
