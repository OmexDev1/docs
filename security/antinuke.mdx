## Why use an antinuke system?

An antinuke system helps protect your server from destructive actions performed by moderators/staff — whether intentionally, accidentally, or through a compromised account. It limits how many high‑impact actions someone can do within a short time window and automatically responds when that limit is exceeded.

## How does **this** antinuke work?

This system is **event + audit‑log + rate‑limit** based.

1. **A server event happens** (e.g. channel created, role deleted, member banned).
2. The bot reads the **Audit Log** to determine **who** performed the action.
3. The bot checks if the actor is **bypassed** (server owner / whitelisted).
4. A **rate limiter** counts how many actions that actor performs within **10 seconds**.
5. If the actor exceeds the configured **threshold**, AntiNuke:
   - **Logs** an alert to your configured log channel (if enabled)
   - **Punishes** the actor (`ban`, `kick`, or `stripstaff`)
   - **Reverts** what it can (e.g. deletes newly‑created channels/roles, reverts permission escalation, removes dangerous roles, deletes mention spam)

### What it can and cannot revert

**Can revert:**
- Channel creation (deletes the created channel after trigger)
- Role creation (deletes the created role after trigger)
- Dangerous permission escalation on roles (reverts permissions back)
- Dangerous roles granted to members (removes the dangerous roles)
- Mention spam (deletes cached mention messages from the last 10 seconds)
- Webhook abuse (deletes abusive webhooks if it has permission)
- Bot adds (kicks unauthorized bots when triggered)

**Cannot reliably revert:**
- Channel deletions (Discord does not provide a true restore)
- Role deletions (same limitation)

AntiNuke will still **punish and log** the actor for deletions.

## Requirements

### Bot permissions (important)

AntiNuke relies heavily on audit logs and moderation permissions. Recommended permissions:

- **View Audit Log** *(required for most modules to function)*
- **Ban Members** *(if you use ban punishment)*
- **Kick Members** *(if you use kick punishment)*
- **Manage Roles** *(required for stripstaff + reverting perms + removing dangerous roles)*
- **Manage Channels** *(required to delete channels it created / clean up)*
- **Manage Webhooks** *(required to remove abusive webhooks)*
- **Read Message History** *(for mention spam deletion)*
- **Manage Messages** *(helps with deleting mention messages)*

> If your bot does not have a required permission, that module may silently fail to punish/revert.

---

## Quick setup

1. Invite the bot with the permissions above.
2. Enable Antinuke: `.antinuke on`
3. Set a log channel: `.antinuke logchannel #logs`
4. Add trusted Antinuke admins (optional): `.antinuke admin @user`
5. Configure modules (recommended set below).
6. Verify config: `.antinuke configuration`

## Core commands

### Enable AntiNuke (server owner only)

<CodeGroup>

```javascript Syntax
.antinuke on
```

```javascript Example
.antinuke on
```

</CodeGroup>

<br />

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/images/security/antinuke/on.png"
    alt=""
    style={{ width:"100%" }}
  />
</Frame>

### Disable AntiNuke (server owner only)

This disables AntiNuke and resets the stored configuration.

<CodeGroup>

```javascript Syntax
.antinuke off
```

```javascript Example
.antinuke off
```

</CodeGroup>

<br />

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/images/security/antinuke/off.png"
    alt=""
    style={{ width:"100%" }}
  />
</Frame>

### Set the log channel (server owner only)

<CodeGroup>

```javascript Syntax
.antinuke logchannel (#channel)
```

```javascript Example
.antinuke logchannel #security-logs
```

</CodeGroup>

#### Disable logging

<CodeGroup>

```javascript Syntax
.antinuke logchannel
```

```javascript Example
.antinuke logchannel
```

</CodeGroup>

<br />

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/images/security/antinuke/logchannel.png"
    alt=""
    style={{ width:"100%" }}
  />
</Frame>

---

## Admins and bypassing

### Allowing other users to configure AntiNuke (server owner only)

The server owner can toggle AntiNuke Admin on a member.

<Warning>
  This is dangerous. AntiNuke Admins can alter protections and reduce thresholds.
</Warning>

<CodeGroup>

```javascript Syntax
.antinuke admin (user)
```

```javascript Example
.antinuke admin @aj.wtf
```

</CodeGroup>

<br />

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/images/security/antinuke/admin.png"
    alt=""
    style={{ width:"100%" }}
  />
</Frame>

### Viewing AntiNuke Admins (server owner only)

<CodeGroup>

```javascript Syntax
.antinuke admins
```

```javascript Example
.antinuke admins
```

</CodeGroup>

<br />

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/images/security/antinuke/admins.png"
    alt=""
    style={{ width:"100%" }}
  />
</Frame>

### Whitelisting (bypass AntiNuke)

Whitelisted users do not trigger antinuke punishments.

<Warning>
  Dangerous: this bypasses ALL modules.
</Warning>

<CodeGroup>

```javascript Syntax
.antinuke whitelist (user)
```

```javascript Example
.antinuke whitelist @jonathan
```

</CodeGroup>

<br />

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/images/security/antinuke/wl.png"
    alt=""
    style={{ width:"100%" }}
  />
</Frame>

#### Unwhitelist

<CodeGroup>

```javascript Syntax
.antinuke unwhitelist (user)
```

```javascript Example
.antinuke unwhitelist @jonathan
```

</CodeGroup>

#### View whitelisted users

<CodeGroup>

```javascript Syntax
.antinuke whitelisted
```

```javascript Example
.antinuke whitelisted
```

</CodeGroup>

<br />

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/images/security/antinuke/whitelisted.png"
    alt=""
    style={{ width:"100%" }}
  />

## Enabling an antinuke module

Modules are configured per feature (ban/kick/channelcreation/etc). Each module is stored with:

- `status` (on/off)
- `punishment` (`ban`, `kick`, `stripstaff`)
- `threshold` (1–12)
- `command` (true/false) *(stored; triggers are event/audit-log based)*

### Available Flags

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Threshold">
    Number of actions allowed in a **10 second** window before AntiNuke triggers.

    <Info>
      Recommended:

      - **1–2** for destructive actions (deletions, dangerous permissions)
      - **2–4** for creation spam (channels/roles)
      - **3–5** for mentions
    </Info>

    <CodeGroup>

    ```javascript Syntax
    --threshold (number)
    ```

    ```javascript Example
    --threshold 3
    ```

    </CodeGroup>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Punishment">
    Action taken against the actor when the module triggers.

    <Info>
      Punishments:

      - `ban`
      - `kick`
      - `stripstaff` (removes staff roles the bot is allowed to remove)
    </Info>

    <CodeGroup>

    ```javascript Syntax
    --do (punishment)
    ```

    ```javascript Example
    --do stripstaff
    ```

    </CodeGroup>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Command detection">
    Stored in configuration as `command: true/false`.

    <Info>
      Triggers rely on server events + audit logs, not command parsing.
      Keep this enabled for consistency with your config schema.
    </Info>

    <CodeGroup>

    ```javascript Syntax
    --command (true | false)
    ```

    ```javascript Example
    --command true
    ```

    </CodeGroup>

## Troubleshooting

### Nothing triggers

- Ensure the bot has **View Audit Log**
- Ensure AntiNuke is enabled: `.antinuke configuration`
- Ensure the specific module is enabled (shows ✅)
- Ensure the bot’s role is high enough to punish/remove roles
- Check your log channel is set properly

### stripstaff doesn’t work

- Bot must have **Manage Roles**
- Bot’s highest role must be **above** the roles it is attempting to remove

### mentions module doesn’t work

- Ensure **Message Content** intent is enabled
- Ensure the bot can read messages in the channels
- Ensure the module is enabled: `.antinuke mentions on ...`
