## **1. Terms of Use**

By accessing or using Omex (the “Bot”), its website, or any related services, you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service, all applicable laws and regulations, and accept full responsibility for compliance with any local laws.

If you do not agree with these Terms, you are prohibited from using Omex or accessing its services. All materials and services are protected by applicable copyright, trademark, and intellectual property laws.

## **2. Use License**

Permission is granted to temporarily download or view one copy of the materials (such as documentation or software) on Omex’s website for personal, non-commercial, and transitory use only. This is a limited license, not a transfer of ownership.

Under this license, you may not:

- Modify or copy the materials.
- Use the materials for any commercial purpose or public display (commercial or non-commercial).
- Attempt to decompile, reverse engineer, or otherwise access the source code of Omex.
- Remove copyright notices, trademarks, or proprietary labels from the materials.
- Transfer the materials to another person or “mirror” them on another server.

This license will automatically terminate if you violate these restrictions. Omex reserves the right to terminate access at any time. Upon termination, you must destroy any downloaded or stored materials, whether in electronic or printed form.

## **3. Disclaimer**

Omex services and materials are provided “as is”. Omex makes no warranties, expressed or implied, and disclaims all other warranties, including but not limited to implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement of intellectual property or other rights.

- Services will be accurate, reliable, or error-free.
- Results from using Omex will meet any specific expectations.
- Services will always operate without interruption or security risks.

## **4. Limitations of Liability**

In no event shall Omex, its developers, or suppliers be liable for any damages (including, without limitation, loss of data, loss of profits, or business interruptions) arising from the use or inability to use its services.

Even if Omex has been informed of the possibility of such damages, liability remains strictly limited. Some jurisdictions do not allow limitations on implied warranties or liability for incidental or consequential damages, so these limitations may not apply in certain cases.

## **5. Accuracy of Information**

The materials provided by Omex may include technical, typographical, or photographic errors. Omex does not guarantee that its materials are accurate, complete, or up-to-date.

Omex may make changes to its materials or services at any time without notice. However, there is no obligation to update or maintain them.

## **6. Modifications to Terms**

Omex reserves the right to revise or update these Terms of Service at any time, without prior notice. By continuing to access or use the Bot or website, you agree to be bound by the most recent version of these Terms.

## **7. Governing Law**

These Terms of Service are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of England and Wales. By using Omex, you irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of England and Wales.

## **⚖️ Summary**

By accessing or using Omex, you agree to comply with these Terms. If you do not accept them, you may not use the Bot, website, or services.
