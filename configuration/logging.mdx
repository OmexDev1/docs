## Overview

Logging lets you send server event logs to one or more channels. This is useful for moderation, auditing, and keeping track of activity.

## Available logging events

<Info>
Available logging events are `messages`, `member`, `roles`, `channels`, `invites`, `emojis`, and `voice`.
</Info>

<Warning>
Do not delete the webhook that Bleed creates in your logging channels — logs are delivered through it.
</Warning>

<Tip>
You can configure up to **3** log channels per server, and each channel can be set to **one** event type (or `all`).
</Tip>

## Adding a logging event

You can enable logging in a channel using the `logs set` command.

<CodeGroup>

```javascript Syntax
,logs set (channel) (event | all)
```

```javascript Example
,logs set #logs messages
,logs set #member-logs member
,logs set #everything all
```

</CodeGroup>

</Frame>

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/configuration/example.png" />
</Frame>

## Removing a logging event

You can remove logging using the `logs remove` command.

<CodeGroup>

```javascript Syntax
,logs remove (event | all)
```

```javascript Example
,logs remove messages
,logs remove all
```

</CodeGroup>

<br />
<Frame>
  <img src="/images/configuration/remove.png" />
</Frame>

<Tip>
If you leave the event parameter empty (or use `all`), logging will be fully disabled for the server.
</Tip>

## Ignoring a member or channel

You can ignore a user or channel so their activity won’t be logged.

<CodeGroup>

```javascript Syntax
,logs ignore (member | channel | voice channel)
```

```javascript Example
,logs ignore @jonathan
,logs ignore #staff-chat
```

</CodeGroup>

---

## Unignoring a member or channel

Remove a user/channel from the ignore list so they will be logged again.

<CodeGroup>

```javascript Syntax
,logs unignore (member | channel | voice channel)
```

```javascript Example
,logs unignore @jonathan
,logs unignore #staff-chat
```

</CodeGroup>
