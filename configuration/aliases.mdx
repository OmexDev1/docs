## Overview

Command aliases let you create **shortcuts** that run an existing command (optionally with preset arguments).
They’re stored per-server, so each guild can have its own alias set.

When an alias is used, the bot rewrites the message content into the target command + arguments, then processes it as if the user typed the full command.

---

## Who can manage aliases?

- **Manage Server** (`Manage Guild`) is required to add/remove/list aliases.
- Regular members can **use** aliases once they exist (normal command permissions/checks still apply).

---

## Creating an alias

Use `alias add`:

<CodeGroup>

```javascript Syntax
,alias add (shortcut) (command) [args...]
```

```javascript Example
,alias add deport ban
```

</CodeGroup>

### What gets stored

Each alias stores:

- `alias`: your shortcut name (example: `deport`)
- `command`: the target command name the bot will run (example: `ban`)
- `arguments`: optional preset arguments (split by spaces)

---

## Predefined arguments (placeholders)

You can include placeholders inside an alias’s preset arguments:

- `{0}` = first user-provided argument
- `{1}` = second user-provided argument
- …and so on

Example:

```javascript
,alias add shh timeout {0} 10m
,shh @jonathan
```

This runs:

- `timeout @jonathan 10m`

### Notes about placeholders

- Placeholder indexing starts at **0**, not 1.
- If a placeholder refers to an argument the user did not supply, it’s treated as empty and skipped.

---

## Removing an alias

Use `alias remove`:

<CodeGroup>

```javascript Syntax
,alias remove (shortcut|all)
```

```javascript Example
,alias remove deport
```

</CodeGroup>

To delete **all** aliases in the server:

```javascript
,alias remove all
```

---

## Listing aliases

Use `alias list`:

<CodeGroup>

```javascript Syntax
,alias list
```

```javascript Example
,alias list
```

</CodeGroup>

This shows every alias in the server and what it expands into.

---

## Limits and safeguards

- Servers can create up to **5 aliases** (unless your bot has a hardcoded exception for a specific guild).
- Aliases cannot conflict with existing command names or built-in aliases.
- Aliases are cached and refreshed periodically, so changes are fast and consistent.

---

## Troubleshooting

### “Conflicts with an existing command/alias”
Rename the alias so it doesn’t match any command name or existing alias.

### “No command found with the name …”
Make sure the target command exists and you typed the correct name.

### Alias runs but the command fails
That’s normal if:
- the user lacks permissions for the target command, or
- the command has other checks (premium, cooldowns, etc.)
